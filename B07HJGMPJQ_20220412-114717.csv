Although, the suction and blow works good, but the body material  is not durable. It is made of very cheap plastic. Especially rods and pipes are vulnerable to break. The vacuum is not value for money.I bought 2 units of this product and the pipes and rods of both broke just on 3rd or 4th use. amazon accepted them back and refunded all the money but such products should not be sold by amazon as it degrades the companies reputation."
127,imran jaffar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best value for money vacuum cleaner,Reviewed in India on 23 July 2021,This is the best value for money vacuum cleaner you can ever buy. For regular homes 1200-1400 watts capacity VC are more than sufficient. This one is fairly priced with the assurance of a mighty brand name. I find the machine to be super handy cleaning tool. Great stuff Black and Decker !
128,Yogesh C Dhokai,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good vacuum cleaner at a reasonable price,Reviewed in India on 12 July 2021,"The product is good and does exactly what it is meant to do. Suction power is strong enough to suck the dust particles from even tiniest of the cracks. Sofa brush is very good and cleans the sofa aptly. Wet suction is an added advantage and helps in removing the water very easily. Though when I bought this, I thought wet is not going to be useful, it came in very handy during 3 different times.I would recommend this vacuum cleaner than anything else that is costly and fancy. This is the best vacuum cleaner available in a very reasonable price. Just go for it."

187,Mahesh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good brand but delivered defective piece even the replacementee,Reviewed in India on 2 April 2021,I have ordered on Amazon and with prime membership I got it delivered very next day. Packaging was a bit damaged but vacuum was brand new and working. But extension tubes and dustbag clip was broken. Raised complaint with Amazon helpdesk and replacement piece was sent very next day. Even this replacement box was not in mint condition. All parts were genuine and brand new but this time the main vaccum it self refused to start. Very disappointing experience.

190,Dharmaraj Balagopalan,3.0 out of 5 stars,A very Average machine .,Reviewed in India on 28 March 2021,Its a pity brands like Black and Decker compromise their brand image by importing low standard machines from China purely keeping cost in mind. No doubt at Rs.5399 for a wet and dry vacuum cleaner is attractive and I decided to fall for it. The first machine was delivered in a carton (manufacturer's) with damage on all four sides and on opening found one wheel of the floor brush missing...so return for replacement. Thankfully the second machine had all parts intact.Machine works satisfactorily so far in both wet and dry mode but the fit and finish overall is not very appealing. The suction seems okay for a new machine but wonder if it will continue after some regular usage. Considering the price the machine is okay I guess....nothing special to write home about.

205,Dushyant Mahadik,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Missing part, spares availability, fluctuating prices",Reviewed in India on 2 March 2021,"The range of vacuum cleaner models in Indian market is limited across all manufacturers. In particular, the international brands don't bring their full range, for instance Philips doesn't have a WD cleaner. Plenty of website reviews have indicated the issues with service network and spares availability, so I won't dwell much on that.I'd like to highlight my reasons for two stars here -1) Part number 3 on the manual (sofa brush) was missing from the box. Worst still, I can't buy it from the market. Yet to call up their service center. I'll be forced to return if generic parts don't fit.2) Price on Amazon changed from 8155 to 5699 within a week, from the same seller. Wonder what's going on there.3) Rated suction (16 KPa) seems to be lower than its peers in the 1 kW+ range. This could be due to inefficient piping (for instance leaky selector of power mode (at the end of flexible pipe). At the same time the noise is higher.4) While most accessories fit in well, the flexible pipe stays an orphan.5) Power plug could have been a 3-pin, even a dummy would do, because most modern houses have safety shutters that don't let two pin in a 15A socket.Pros : high rated power (1400 W), sturdy design, washable filter, reusable bag, HEPA filter wouldn't spread germs, functional vacuum cleaner that does what it is supposed to.Cons : Spares availability - no parts on Amazon or their own site. List price fluctuates by as much as 33%."
